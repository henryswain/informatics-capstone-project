o Stories completed
- reworked cards to show information that users will want to see when quickly scrolling through jobs 
(salary, location, part-time/full-time as opposed to job description, basic qual requirements, prefered skills and to apply).
-fixed styling of learn button button
-made learn more button open up modal with more full information about the job; content which was originally visible when scrolling
 through the cards (job description, basic qual requirements, prefered skills, to apply), but ultimately made more sense to be visible when "learning more"
o Progress report 
- good progress was made, It's now much easier to see what jobs are available on a quick scroll, but the full information is readily available 
with a well styled learn more button
o Plan for next week
-start to implement a job filtering system

Team member 2: Marcus Bodnar
o Stories completed
- Added Styling to home page
- Made navbar compatible with different screen sizes (responsiveness)
- Filter compatible for different screen sizes
o Progress report 
- Things went well and the page looks more presentable now after adding the screen size responsiveness. I did not get around to the filters working since we were worries more about the layout of the page rather than overall functionality yet.
- See if I can get the filtering next week instead.
