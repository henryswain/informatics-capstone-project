Team member 2: Marcus Bodnar
o Stories completed
- Added Styling to home page
- Made navbar compatible with different screen sizes (responsiveness)
- Filter compatible for different screen sizes
o Progress report 
- Things went well and the page looks more presentable now after adding the screen size responsiveness. I did not get around to the filters working since we were worries more about the layout of the page rather than overall functionality yet.
- See if I can get the filtering next week instead.
o Plan for next week
Work on login/signup pages
