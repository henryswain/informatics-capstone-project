o Stories completed
- created lambda function to read data from CSV file from S3 bucket into table in DynamoDB
- Create lambda function to read/filter job data from dynamo DB table Based on optional event parameters, including search For filtering jobs based on keyword,
 And pageToken To ensure that the remaining data Is queried On subsequent calls (not the full data set)..
- Set up an API endpoint on API Gateway that accepts query string parameters (search and pageToken) To call the lambda Function
- Reworked frontend to call the API and read data from object returned Instead of using a WSGI file.
o Progress report
- Overall successful, But I ran into some roadblocks with lambda's limitations. Apparently, PartIQL (AWS's sql compatable query language) has a maximum Return size of 1MB
And lambda itself has a maximum return size of 6 MB, Which meant that it was impossible To return all the results in one API call, So I had to figure out a way to
Call the API multiple times until there were no more results.
o Plan for next week
-Will be determined on Monday
