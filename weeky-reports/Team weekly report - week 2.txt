* Team member 1: Henry Swain
o Stories completed
- initiallized vue and bootstrap in repository with basic navbar skeleton
- loaded necessary columns from csv job data into table on webdev database
- created first draft (not working) of wsgi file for querying all jobs.
- linked jobview.wsgi (Topher created this as a fixed version of my failed attempt) to FindJobs page in vue app
o Progress report 
 half of my work was more starting parts of the page (vue and bootstrap initiallization, and failed attempt at the wsgi file), 
 but I was able to successfully populate the a table in the webdev database, and link Tophers fix to the vue page, 
 but singificant work still needs to be done for job filtering. 
 Additionally, the vue page won't load on webdev.
o Plan for next week
- clean up the way the list of jobs looks in the vue page
- get at least basic filtering of jobs working
- figure out why vue page won't load on webdev

* Team member 4: Ryan Witcraft
o Stories completed
- Started planning for profile page
- Added forms for user input to change profile information
o Progress report
Got at least a baseline made for how the profile page is going to be set up. I still have to figure out a way to use Amazon AWS or some other
form of storing information for the user with Vue. 
o Plan for next week
- Refine layout of the profile page
- Higher functionality for the profile page
- Possibly look more into the storing of profile information

* Team member 5: Topher Wallerich
o Stories completed
    - Worked a bit on the CSV to database python file but was having issues with my machine so mainly just offered occasional ideas
    - Debugged the WSGI file for displaying our database table's contents and got it working so we can now view data in a relatively clean manner
o Progress report
    - Achieved my goal of completing the WSGI file though I mainly acted as a debugger as I didn't have much time this week to begin    work myself
    - Began work on the ability to click on a button to expand individual entries in the dataset to learn more about them
o Plan for next week
    - Finish implementing query string parameters to the page for displaying individual entries. As it stands I'm hung up on getting the string from the URL and exposing it to the python environment so it can be included in the sql query.
