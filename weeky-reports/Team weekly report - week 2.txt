* Team member 1: Henry Swain
o Stories completed
- initiallized vue and bootstrap in repository with basic navbar skeleton
- loaded necessary columns from csv job data into table on webdev database
o Progress report 
 The above was done successfully, but I keep getting permission denied errors when I try to cd inside
 the webdev directory (I think I accidentally locked myself out when using -R flag in my chmod command, or by running it from the wrong directory), 
 which puts my progress towards getting the data into the site from the table on hold, until I get advice from Professor Kleiman.
o Plan for next week
- load job data from webdev db into website.
- get basic job filtering incorporated.

* Team member 3: Ryan Witcraft
o Stories completed
- Started planning for profile page
- Added forms for user input to change profile information
o Progress report
Got at least a baseline made for how the profile page is going to be set up. I still have to figure out a way to use Amazon AWS or some other
form of storing information for the user with Vue. 
o Plan for next week
- Refine layout of the profile page
- Higher functionality for the profile page
- Possibly look more into the storing of profile information
