Marcus Notes:
We can use the career quest button and maybe make a logo there to where u 
click on it and it auto goes to the home screen.

Change the options of the navbar to make it less clustered(especially on mobile)

Maybe just the search, login, signup and one other thing since FindJobs will be the home screen
Unless we make a informative guide for the homepage idk So we can keep the find jobs button
 We will probably want the profile to include a profile picture and different 
 boxes like "Major, Qualities, Background, Other companies worked for"
 Just informative stuff

I will add more tomorrow/friday. Me sleepy

I wonder if we should make instead of a find jobs button we can do a
box checker system and everytime we check a box it would refresh the jobs
that fall under those categories 

Remember to install dependencies into the webdev to see if they work
